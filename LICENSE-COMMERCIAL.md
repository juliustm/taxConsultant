# Commercial License

The TaxConsult AI Agent is open-source under the AGPLv3 license, which is ideal for personal use, internal business use, and community collaboration.

However, if you wish to use this software in a proprietary, closed-source commercial product or SaaS offering where the source-sharing requirements of the AGPLv3 are not suitable for your business model, you must obtain a commercial license.

A commercial license grants you the right to:

*   Integrate the TaxConsult AI Agent into your proprietary applications without being obligated to open-source your own code.
*   Receive dedicated support and influence the project's development roadmap.
*   Build and sell services based on this powerful platform.
