# TaxConsult AI - Local Development Environment Variables
#
# This file is used by `docker-compose.yml` to set environment variables
# for the application during local development.
#
# DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE TO GIT.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Flask Application Settings ---

# A long, random string used by Flask to securely sign session cookies.
# The default is fine for local use, but you can generate a new one with:
# python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(24))'
SECRET_KEY='a-super-secret-key-for-local-development-that-is-very-long'


# --- Asynchronous Task Runner Settings ---

# A secret key to protect the `/tasks/run` endpoint from being triggered by
# unauthorized users. You will use this in your browser or Postman to test
# the queue runner locally.
# Example URL: http://localhost:5000/tasks/run?secret=my-local-cron-job-secret-12345
TASK_RUNNER_SECRET_KEY='my-local-cron-job-secret-12345'


# --- Notes on Production ---
# On a deployment platform like Deploy.tz, these variables should not be
# uploaded in this file. Instead, they should be set securely through the
# platform's "Environment Variables" dashboard.
